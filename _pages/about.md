***I am on the 2024 - 2025 job market. Meet me at the 2024 FMA annual meeting in Dallas, Texas!***

I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Economics at Tilburg University. My research interests are **Climate Finance**, International Economics, and Empirical Banking. I am supervised by Prof. Harry Huizinga, Prof. Harald Benink, and Dr. Louis Raes.

I am intrigued by how capital markets can contribute to the global public good problem of climate change. In my dissertation, I delve into financial markets' responses to climate change, with a particular focus on the international provision of brown financing. In three chapters, I investigate three forms of capital flows that go beyond country borders: share equity investment, direct investment of M&A, and bank lending. I reveal the extent of the international transfer of climate risks behind these capital flows.
