***I am on the 2024 - 2025 job market. Meet me at the 2024 FMA annual meeting in Dallas, Texas!***

I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Economics at Tilburg University. My research interests are **Climate Finance**, International Economics, and Empirical Banking. I am supervised by Prof. Harry Huizinga, Prof. Harald Benink, and Dr. Louis Raes.
[CV](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/qijnx8gppf8potsj0bdlx/cv.pdf?rlkey=424j0xubetuhuwn012fmc4hv2&st=wbc0d7eu&dl=0)
Previously, I studied at the Stockholm School of Economics (Master's in Economics) and the Renmin University of China (Bachelor's in Economics). 




I am fascinated by the interaction of capital markets and political responses to the global public good problem of climate change. In my dissertation, I delve into the responses of financial markets to climate change, with a particular focus on the international provision of brown financing. In three chapters, I investigate three forms of capital flows that go beyond country borders: share equity investment, direct investment of M&A, and bank lending, and I reveal the extent of international transfer of climate risks.
