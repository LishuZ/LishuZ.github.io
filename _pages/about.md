**Welcome to my personal website. I am on the job market 2024 - 2025. Meet me at the 2024 FMA annual meeting in Dallas, Texas!**

I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Economics at Tilburg University. My research interests are Climate Finance, International Economics, and Empirical Banking. I am supervised by Prof. Harry Huizinga, Prof. Harald Benink, and Dr. Louis Raes. 

I am fascinated by the interaction of capital markets and political responses to the global public good problem of climate change. In my dissertation, I delve into the responses of financial markets to climate change, with a particular focus on the international provision of brown financing. In three chapters, I discuss respectively three forms of capital flows that go beyond country borders: share equity investment, direct investment of M&A, and bank lending, and how the extent of these capital flows reflect the decarbonization efforts vary with the home country characteristics of the investors.

Previously, I studied at the Stockholm School of Economics (Master's in Economics) and the Renmin University of China (Bachelor's in Economics).
