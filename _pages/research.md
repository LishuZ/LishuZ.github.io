## Job Market Paper
### International trade in brown loans
I derive a theory-based asset gravity equation for international bank lending and define a measure for the asymmetric change in lending to firms with carbon heterogeneity, i.e., carbon sensitivity of lending. Using the syndicated loan data, I document that countries with different levels of economic development undergo diverging sectoral recomposition in their aggregate loan portfolios. The decarbonization trend in country loan portfolios is mainly driven by changes in their domestic credit allocation, suggesting that an international market exists for climate risk transfer. I then provide micro evidence that a positive relationship exists between the carbon sensitivity of lending and economic development, which is robust against potential selloffs. Moreover, my result suggests that bank specialization is a key factor explaining the domestic-foreign wedge in portfolio decarbonization. The resistance observed in foreign lending can be due to the international risk relocation of highly specialized banks from richer countries. Exploiting the ECB's supervisory expectation change, I show that regulatory arbitrage is a driver of such risk relocation. The co-existence of risk transfer between banks and risk relocation by certain banks highlights the importance of understanding international balances of brown assets.

## Working Paper
### International trade in brown shares and economic development
with Harald Benink, Harry Huizinga, and Louis Raes. [CEPR](https://cepr.org/publications/dp18856) [VoxEU](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/international-trade-brown-shares-and-economic-development)

Using global share ownership data from 2002 to 2021, we find that investorsâ€™ aggregate carbon sensitivity, i.e. their tendency to divest from more polluting firms, increases with per capita GDP. Especially investment managers, who invest on behalf of their clients, and investors with longer investment horizons contribute to the portfolio greening effect of economic development. We find that this effect is weaker for smaller firms and for firms that are included in the MSCI World Index. By acting as backstop owners of brown equities, investors in poorer countries could limit the impact of divestment of such equities in richer countries.

## Working in Progress
### Location matters: cross-border M\&As and pricing of ESG assets
In this paper, I study the direction determination of international mergers between firms with differentials in their Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) capacities. The cumulative abnormal returns in response to the M\&A announcements between two firms with ESG differentials are higher for the deal with a greener acquirer, suggesting that the market holds an asymmetric belief on the potential impact of M\&A on the future ESG performance. Consistent with the hypothesis that firms exploit this asymmetric belief and deliberately design the deal direction, I find both ESG disclosure practices and the actual emission levels have an impact on the direction choice of an M\&A deal. However, the ex-post ESG evaluation of the merged firm always fails the ex-ante expectation. Acquiring a relatively green firm does not proportionately improve the post-merger ESG rating or emission performance of the acquirer, and acquiring a brown firm does not, in fact, shock the host firm's ESG evaluation as negatively as how much the market would demand compensation for.
